# LocaliZoom
EBRAINS LocaliZoom serial section image viewer provides an intuitive way of navigating high resolution 2D image series coupled with segmentation overlay, from a web browser. At its core, it is a web-based pan-and-zoom 2D image viewer coupled with a volumetric atlas slicer, and a navigational aid showing the entire image series as a “filmstrip”. Building on the open standard Deep Zoom Image (DZI) format, it is able to efficiently visualise very large brain images in the gigapixel range, allowing to zoom from common, display-sized overview resolutions down to the microscopic resolution without downloading the underlying very large image dataset.

**Users can access LocaliZoom through the LocaliView service**
