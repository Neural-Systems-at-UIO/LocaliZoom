**What is LocaliZoom?**
------------------- 
EBRAINS LocaliZoom serial section image viewer provides an intuitive way
of navigating high-resolution 2D image series coupled with segmentation
overlay, from a web browser. At its core, it is a web-based pan-and-zoom
2D image viewer coupled with a volumetric atlas slicer, and a
navigational aid showing the entire image series as a "filmstrip".
Building on the open standard Deep Zoom Image (DZI) format, it is able
to efficiently visualise very large brain images in the gigapixel range,
allowing to zoom from common, display-sized overview resolutions down to
the microscopic resolution without downloading the underlying very large
image dataset.

The LocaliView workflow is accessible with an EBRAINS account.
