**Introduction**
------------------- 
EBRAINS LocaliZoom serial section image viewer provides an intuitive way
of navigating high-resolution 2D image series coupled with segmentation
overlay, from a web browser. At its core, it is a web-based pan-and-zoom
2D image viewer coupled with a volumetric atlas slicer, and a
navigational aid showing the entire image series as a "filmstrip".
Building on the open standard Deep Zoom Image (DZI) format, it is able
to efficiently visualise very large brain images in the gigapixel range,
allowing to zoom from common, display-sized overview resolutions down to
the microscopic resolution without downloading the underlying very large
image dataset. Annotations of the images are enabled in a separate
instance of LocaliZoom, which will be available on EBRAINS shortly.

*Key features*:
  - Visualisation of experimental histological section images with atlas overlay 
  - Display of the atlas region name when pointing the mouse at the region of interest
  - Annotations and extraction of coordinate points when enabled
