**LocaliZoom viewer and annotation tool**
--------------------------------------------

The same basic viewing controls applies and in addition extraction of a limited
number of coordinates, e.g. representing an electrode track or labelling
within a small region of interest is possible. Users can inspect the
images at cellular resolution and observe brain regions, names, and
boundaries and annotate points in order to extract coordinates.

**Controls**:

• Press Space to annotate points of interest. The color of the points can be changed by clicking on the "Settings button" and on the color. 
• Press Delete to remove an annotation marker under the mouse cursor

The points are saved automatically.


**Viewing point coordinates in MeshView**

The saved points can be visualised in the 3D viewer, MeshView (https://meshview-for-brain-atlases.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) which is also available in the LocaliView workbench.
